# [ ] Write a program to:
# 1) ask the user for a number between 1000 and 9999
# 2) test if the number matches the first line of any file in `files_directory`
# 3) if a match was found, print the file name; otherwise, print no match is found
# 4) your code should handle exception appropriately (i.e. a blank file or a file containing a string in the first line)
# 5) you should use `with` statement for opening/closing files
# 6) make sure the to run the environment setup code before running your own program.

# test cases:
# 3932, should print out: Match found in 74.txt : 3932
# 2177, should print out: Match found in 27.txt : 2177
# 4932, should print out: No matching files found
